                A 2017 review of clinical trials found that drinking coffee is generally safe within usual levels of
                intake and is more likely to improve health outcomes than to cause harm at doses of 3 or 4 cups of
                coffee daily. Exceptions include possible increased risk in women having bone fractures, and a possible
                increased risk in pregnant women of fetal loss or decreased birth weight. Results were complicated by
                poor study quality, and differences in age, gender, health status, and serving size.

            <p class="text-start">Coffee beans are the seeds of a fruit called a coffee cherry. Coffee cherries grow on
                coffee trees from a
                genus of plants called Coffea. There are a wide variety of species of coffee plants, ranging from shrubs
                to trees.</p>

            <ul class="mb-0">
                <li class="text-start mb-3">
                    <b>Type of bean.</b> There are two main types of coffee species, Arabica and Robusta. Arabica
                    originates
                    from Ethiopia and produces a mild, flavorful tasting coffee. It is the most popular type worldwide.
                    However, it is expensive to grow because the Arabica plant is sensitive to the environment,
                    requiring shade, humidity, and steady temperatures between 60-75 degrees Fahrenheit. The Robusta
                    coffee plant is more economical to grow because it is resistant to disease and survives in a wider
                    range of temperatures between 65 - 97 degrees Fahrenheit. It can also withstand harsh climate
                    changes such as variations in rainfall and strong sunlight.

                <li class="text-start mb-3">
                    <b>Type of roast.</b> Coffee beans start out green. They are roasted at a high heat to produce a
                    chemical
                    change that releases the rich aroma and flavor associate with coffee. They are then cooled and
                    ground for brewing. Roasting levels range from light to medium to dark. The lighter the roast,
                    lighter the color and roasted flavor and the higher its acidity and a bitter roasted flavor. The
                    popular french roast is medium-dark

                <li class="text-start mb-3">
                    <b>Type of grind.</b> A medium grind is the most common and used for automatic drip coffee makers. A
                    fine
                    grind is used for deeper flavors like espresso, releases the oils, and a coarse grind is used in
                    coffee presses.
